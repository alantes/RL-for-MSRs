Supplementary code and movies for "Adaptive actuation of magnetic soft robot using deep reinforcement learning". Our work is based on [PyElastica](https://github.com/GazzolaLab/PyElastica) and [Elastica-RL-control](https://github.com/GazzolaLab/Elastica-RL-control).

For detailed description of the cases please refer to our preprint (currently on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11475) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360187327_Adaptive_actuation_of_magnetic_soft_robots_using_deep_reinforcement_learning)).
